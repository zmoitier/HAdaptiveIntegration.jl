    @kwdef struct TabulatedEmbeddedCubature{DOM<:AbstractDomain} <: AbstractRule{DOM}

An embedded cubature rule consisting of a high order cubature rule and a low order cubature
rule. Note that the low order cubature uses `nodes[1:L]` as its nodes where `L` is the
length of the `weights_low`. The cubature nodes and weights are assumed to be for the
reference domain (use the [`reference_domain`](@ref) function to get the reference domain).

## Fields:
- `description::String`: description of the embedded cubature.
- `reference::String`: where the values are found.
- `order_high::Int`: order of the high order cubature.
- `order_low::Int`: order of the low order cubature.
- `precision::Int`: number of significant digits on the node and weight values,
  `10^-precision` give the relative precision of the values.
- `nodes::Vector{Vector{String}}`: the cubature nodes.
- `weights_high::Vector{String}`: the cubature weights for the high order cubature.
- `weights_low::Vector{String}`: the cubature weights for the low order cubature.

## Invariants (check at construction):
- `length(nodes) == length(weights_high)`
- `length(weights_high) ≥ length(weights_low)`
- `order_high ≥ order_low` ≥ 0
- `precision ≥ 0`
